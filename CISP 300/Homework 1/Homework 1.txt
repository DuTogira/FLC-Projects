Start
	Set euroValue = USD * .89
	Set yenValue = USD * 118.43
	Display "Would you like to convert to Euros or Yen?"
	Input userResponse
	Display "Please input the quantity of USD you would like converted."
	Input USD
		If userResponse = "Euros"
			Output euroValue
			Display euroValue
		Else								//I used an else statement because most users will input one of the two keywords asked for earlier in the program, but all the same, I thought being able to input "Fried Chicken" and still have the program convert USD to Yen was a nice fail-safe, and comedic gold
			Output yenValue
			Display yenValue
