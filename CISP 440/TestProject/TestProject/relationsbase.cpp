/*
Reads in a matrix from a binary file and determines RST and EC's.  

Dan Ross          Sep 2014

The input files are binary files with the following format: 
the first byte is the size of the relation, 
followed by a byte for each element of the matrix, 
filling rows from left to right.  

For example, a file with the following byte sequence:

   4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1
   
represents the following matrix, R:

   1, 1, 0, 1,
   1, 1, 0, 1,
   0, 0, 1, 0, 
   1, 1, 0, 1

Given a set A = {0, 1, 2, 3} we can label R as follows:

       0  1  2  3
   0   1, 1, 0, 1,
   1   1, 1, 0, 1,
   2   0, 0, 1, 0, 
   3   1, 1, 0, 1
   
So, the above matrix represents the a relation R on set A where,

R = {(0,0) (0,1) (0,3) (1,0) (1,1) (1,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,2) (3,3)}

Which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.  This makes it an
equivalence relation with the following equivalence classes:

[0] = {0 1 3}
[2] = {2}

/*
Finds equivalence classes and elects representatives of each class.

EC will contain a list of class representatives aka "captians" represented
as an array of boolean flags.

Each row in a matrix represents an equivalence class.  But there may be
several duplicate rows.  Our task is to find the captian of each class, 
which will be the first member of the class.

ALGORITHM:
0 is always a captian

For elements 1 thru N, assign each as a captian
then, go to that elements row and look backwards for members less than this.
If found, demote the captian.
This works because captains are the first members of their class.  Think about it.
